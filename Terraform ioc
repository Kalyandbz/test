Here's a 5-level structured learning path for mastering **Terraform (IaC)** as an Azure DevOps Engineer. Each level builds progressively from beginner to expert with 10 practice tasks per level.

---

### **Level 1: Terraform Basics (Beginner)**

1. **Install Terraform** on your local machine (Windows/Linux).
2. **Create your first Terraform configuration file** to deploy a simple Azure Resource Group.
3. Use `terraform init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.
4. **Define providers and versions** in your `.tf` files.
5. **Create variables** using `variable` blocks and use them in resources.
6. **Output values** using `output` blocks.
7. **Use locals** to simplify expressions in your configuration.
8. Create and use a `.tfvars` file for input variables.
9. **Deploy an Azure Storage Account** using Terraform.
10. Practice **state management** (`terraform show`, `terraform state list`, etc.).

---

### **Level 2: Intermediate Infrastructure**

1. **Use Terraform backend** to store the state file remotely in Azure Storage.
2. Create a **Virtual Network** and **Subnets** in Azure.
3. Deploy an **Azure Virtual Machine** using Terraform.
4. Attach **Network Interfaces (NICs)** to your VM.
5. Use **Data sources** to reference existing Azure resources.
6. Use **Conditional expressions and count** to create multiple resources.
7. Deploy an **Azure App Service** and App Service Plan.
8. **Use modules from the Terraform Registry** in your code.
9. Split code into multiple files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf).
10. **Use Terraform CLI commands** for state manipulation (e.g., `state rm`, `state mv`).

---

### **Level 3: Modular Infrastructure**

1. **Create a custom reusable Terraform module** for Azure Resource Groups.
2. Organize your code with **modules, environments, and workspaces**.
3. Write a module for deploying **Azure VMs with networking**.
4. **Version control your Terraform code** using Git.
5. Use **Terraform workspaces** for environment isolation (dev/test/prod).
6. **Validate and lint** your Terraform code (`terraform validate`, `tflint`).
7. Create **Dynamic blocks** for flexible resource definitions.
8. Use **For\_each and map/list variables** to deploy multiple similar resources.
9. Write **unit tests** using `terraform-compliance` or `terratest`.
10. Deploy and manage **Azure Key Vaults** with access policies.

---

### **Level 4: Advanced DevOps Integration**

1. Integrate Terraform in **Azure DevOps Pipelines (YAML-based)**.
2. **Secure secrets using Key Vault** and pass them to Terraform via pipelines.
3. Use **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise** or **remote state locking**.
4. Implement **approval steps and manual intervention** in Terraform deployment pipelines.
5. Create a **pipeline with Terraform Plan as a preview step**.
6. Use **Terraform with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools**.
7. Implement **Terraform state locking and backend with Azure Cosmos DB**.
8. Automate **Terraform drift detection and remediation**.
9. Use **feature flags** or **branch-based deployments** in Git workflows.
10. Implement **error handling and retries** in Terraform pipelines.

---

### **Level 5: Expert Use Cases and Optimization**

1. Design a **multi-region, multi-subscription infrastructure** using Terraform.
2. Manage **cross-tenant deployments** with Azure Lighthouse and Terraform.
3. Create **enterprise-level modules with documentation and versioning**.
4. Use **Terraform CDK (Cloud Development Kit)** with Python or TypeScript.
5. Build a **Terraform Module Registry** internally for your organization.
6. Enforce **policy as code** with Sentinel or Azure Policy integrated with Terraform.
7. Perform **blue-green deployments or canary deployments** with Terraform.
8. Manage **network security and firewall rules** across multiple VNETs and peering.
9. Conduct **Terraform security audits** with tfsec, checkov, etc.
10. Architect and deploy a **highly available AKS cluster** with autoscaling and monitoring using Terraform.
