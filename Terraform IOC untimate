3. Initialize Terraform with Azure provider (`azurerm`)
4. Configure authentication using Azure CLI
5. Write code to create a Resource Group
6. Add variables for location and name
7. Use `terraform plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`
8. Create a basic Storage Account
9. Add tags to your resources
10. Use `terraform.tfvars` to separate values
11. Organize code using `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`
12. Create a basic Virtual Network
13. Add a subnet to the Virtual Network
14. Create a Public IP and Network Interface
15. Understand the Terraform state file
16. Use `terraform output` to get values
17. Add a lock to state file using Azure Storage backend
18. Create a basic Web App Plan
19. Deploy an App Service (Web App)
20. Destroy and recreate infrastructure to see changes

---

## ✅ **Level 2 – Intermediate (Modules, Dependencies, and Secrets)**

**Goal:** Use modules, handle secrets, and build connections between services.

1. Break your project into modules (e.g., RG module, Storage module)
2. Pass variables into modules and use outputs
3. Reference outputs between modules
4. Use Terraform `depends_on` to manage resource dependency
5. Store secrets using `locals` securely
6. Use Key Vault to store secrets (manually for now)
7. Use `data` blocks to fetch existing resources
8. Create an ACR (Azure Container Registry)
9. Integrate ACR with Web App using identity
10. Use lifecycle blocks (create\_before\_destroy)
11. Import existing Azure resources into Terraform
12. Add `count` and `for_each` to create multiple subnets
13. Use `terraform fmt` and `validate`
14. Create Application Insights and connect with Web App
15. Store Terraform state in Azure Storage Account (Remote Backend)
16. Use `output` from one resource as input to another
17. Create a user-assigned Managed Identity
18. Assign identity to Web App
19. Grant identity access to Storage Account
20. Test access from Web App to Storage using Identity

---

## ✅ **Level 3 – Advanced (SQL, Networking, and AKS Basics)**

**Goal:** Create complex resources, introduce databases and start container workloads.

1. Deploy an Azure SQL Server using Terraform
2. Deploy an Azure SQL Database under the server
3. Set an admin login and password using secrets
4. Whitelist your IP using a firewall rule
5. Create a VNet with multiple subnets
6. Associate Web App with VNet using VNet integration
7. Enable Private Endpoint for Storage Account
8. Create an AKS Cluster
9. Configure Node Pool and Version
10. Attach ACR to AKS using service principal
11. Deploy sample app to AKS using Helm
12. Create Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secrets from Terraform
13. Add DNS label to AKS public IP
14. Set AKS RBAC using AAD integration (basic)
15. Create Private DNS Zone for AKS
16. Use Terraform `data` to reference container image from ACR
17. Use Managed Identity in AKS to access SQL DB
18. Use subnet delegation for AKS and Web Apps
19. Automate environment setup using `env.tfvars` files
20. Define conditional resources with `count` + `var.enable_feature`

---

## ✅ **Level 4 – Proficient (Security, Integration, Automation)**

**Goal:** Harden security, automate deployments, and create full integrations.

1. Use Azure Key Vault with Terraform and fetch secrets
2. Assign Key Vault access policies to Managed Identities
3. Setup Azure Monitor Alerts for Web App
4. Configure Diagnostic Settings on Storage and Web Apps
5. Enable logging and diagnostics for SQL Server
6. Automate Terraform Plan/Apply with GitHub Actions
7. Use `azurerm_role_assignment` to assign RBAC roles
8. Create a role assignment for AKS MI to pull from ACR
9. Assign SQL DB Contributor role to Web App MI
10. Secure Web App with Private Endpoint
11. Use NSGs to restrict traffic to Subnets
12. Create Recovery Services Vault for backup
13. Enable soft delete on Storage Account and SQL
14. Create multiple environments (dev, test, prod)
15. Create reusable Terraform modules with versioning
16. Store modules in GitHub and use in project
17. Use conditional expressions for resource targeting
18. Enable customer-managed keys for Storage
19. Connect SQL DB to VNet using Private Endpoint
20. Tag resources with environment, owner, cost-center

---

## ✅ **Level 5 – Expert (Enterprise-Scale, DR, Governance)**

**Goal:** Implement enterprise-scale IaC practices with security, DR, and scaling.

1. Build a fully automated multi-tier architecture (Web App + SQL + Storage)
2. Use advanced for\_each + dynamic blocks for complex configs
3. Deploy and scale AKS cluster with node pools and autoscaling
4. Use availability zones for high availability
5. Enable geo-replication on Storage and SQL
6. Use Azure Policy to enforce tag governance
7. Integrate with Azure Blueprints (IaC templates)
